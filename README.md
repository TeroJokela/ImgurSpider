WARNING: THIS PROGRAM DOWNLOADS PICTURES FROM IMGUR.COM WHICH IS AN EXTERNAL SOURCE WHERE YOU CAN'T REALLY CONTROL WHAT YOU GET.
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE ABOUT WHAT YOU GET IN ANY WAY
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

# So what does this module do?
If used as it's own, you will need to insert a tag (such as: "cat") and the program will automatically download ~XX of the pictures that have your tag in the description or title.

So it's a web crawler that also downloads the images and saves them either as .jpg or .gif (depending on if the picture is a GIF or not) to a specific folder that it will automatically create (if one doesn't already exist)
